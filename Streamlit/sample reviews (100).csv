190,ibis budget Singapore Pearl, April 2015,Clean budget hotel,"Stayed at the Pearl for two nights after a recent cruise. Chose it after reading reviews and based on its price with our limited budget. Let me say that you definitely get what you pay for - this is a budget hotel. It has very little in the way of facilities. Having said that, it was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. However, they could have offered more useful information without being asked (like advising that you had to switch on an unlabeled power circuit to obtain any hot water). So if you need to know anything, ask reception. The surrounding area is very dirty and busy with local vendors everywhere in the streets. Although they were not in your face trying to sell their wares. A local bus could get you to Bugis Junction and the MRT in 15mins. We found that a",3

But surprisingly, instead of being overwelmed by the number of people trying to check in at the same time, one of the front desk staff, Shiela,greeted us with a smile and effortlessly check us in without any hassle or delay. A warm welcome after a tiring day indeed for us. Kudos to her. The room itself is wat we exoected it to be. Despite the size, it was pleasantly comfortable and we felt right at home. Basic necessities was more than adequately met and the bed, will have you drooling in your sleep in no time. A wonderful stay for us. And it all start with shiela.",4
4731,ibis budget Singapore Ruby, January 2013,It's a give and take,"Most decent hotels in Singapore are really expensive. This one was the cheapest and cleanest I could find. Upon arriving at the hotel, i noticed it immediately. Many hookers right outside the corner of the hotel. Around 30 feet from the entrance.. or a little more. You could literally watch them negotiate deals as you walk by them to get to the main street. It didn't bother me much because i was already aware of this and had my boyfriend with me whenever we were out. Check in was quick and the staff were always nice and polite. The lobby had a very strong perfume smell.. i guess they were going with the name of the hotel. They also had a couple of vending machines downstairs which was nice. As many reviewers had already mentioned, it IS, as big as a matchbox. We didn't have",3

The location of the hotel is good, it is a 2-3 minutes walk to lavender station. We arrived about 10:30 AM, we are told by front desk staffs, that the check-in time is 3pm. I requested for 1pm, she answered that she will try her best. We left our luggage and proceed to Universal Studio. The front desk staffs are courteous. We return to the hotel by 8 pm. The check-in process was smooth. One of the staffs helped us with our luggage. We are dismayed because when we entered our room, it is NOT YET MADE UP AND CLEANED. Maybe the previous guests have just left. This is a shortcoming on their part because our room should have been readied by at least 1 pm. We waited for 20-30 minutes for the room to be cleaned. I",3

The hotel is actually an intermediate lot of a high rise 'shophouse' (land is scarce in Singapore!). It's quite a small narrow hotel. The reception was good & there was 3-4 computers nearby for paid Internet. No free Wifi here. The interior deco of the hotel was chic stylish. Outside looks plain though. I stayed in a double bedroom. No windows, the room was small but very clean & modern with a flat screen TV hanging above. Coffee & tea provided. I can't remember if there was a minibar. For the money we paid (if i remembered correctly <$90/night) it was well worth it. Breakfast was provided (2 coupons for each room).

4524,ibis budget Singapore Ruby, April 2013,Best Value in Singapore,"Compared to the rest of Southeast Asia, Singapore is not cheap. The Fragrance Hotel chain is one of the best values in Singapore and the Fragrance Ruby is one of the nicer hotels, but be warned--it's not for everyone. First of all, it's located in Geylong, away from the tourist area and right in the heart of the red light district. The area is not dangerous, but male travellers will be propositioned by working women in the area. In my opinion though, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of staying here. Geylong is a working class area with some of the most delicious food on the planet. It is easily accessible by the MRT Train or bus and hotel rates are much lower than other parts of Singapore. Many budget and business travelers do choose to stay here. Rooms are small, but",5

The family room we booked was clean alright at least on the spaces that are noticeable. It was unfortunate that I dropped an earring and was forced to look under my bed and lo and behold, all the dust seemed to have been swept under it. The dust was so thick that it formed in cotton like balls and all of a sudden i felt like I caught a bad case of asthma.I immediately reported it to the front desk but didn't bother anymore checking if it got cleaned. i was just afraid of what i might see...

The loft style although not really suitable for family with little children really help make this place look a bit spacious.It stated max of 3 adults but actually it's still enough space for 4 adults.But not recommended since the receptionist will ask all guest passport upon check in and sometimes ask your ID if you enter the lobby at odd hours in midnite. It's a newly renovated hotel, therefore everything it's still in good condition. The beds are clean and comfy.

The room itself was tiny - just about right for tourists like us who hardly spend any time at the room apart from retiring for the night. The bathroom, well, I haven't seen such a small bathroom in my life but it is sufficient. One of the problems we had was that since there was no ventilation from the bathroom, it would stink really badly - probably the duct was connected to other rooms but that was one door that had to be shut at all times. The hotel is located in the red light area of Singapore but we did not face any problems because of that. On the contrary, it was interesting for us to observe this facet of the city.

The ordinary rooms are all tiny without windows, so we upgraded to a deluxe room for 10$/night extra, which was a great choice since the room felt immediately more spacious with a window. We like Geylang area because of the great restaurants, but it is a long walk to the nearest metro station, so not the most convenient location.

The bed only had a bottom bed sheet on with no sheet to go on top, so we thought maybe the maid had just forgotten to make the bed properly, considering on the photos the bed looks made up to be lovely.

The room was indeed extremely small with just enough room for the bed. The bathroom was a combination toilet and shower in a room the size of an old school phone booth.

I have never experienced a bathroom where there was a shower in the corner consisting of about 9 tiles, no shower screen and everything got wet. Rooms that had windows looked on to other buildings and you had to keep the curtains closed for privacy.To enter or leave the hotel there were about 10 steep steps, no ramp to get your luggage up and from what I saw most people had large suitcases, perhaps like us had travelled for many weeks before visiting Singapore on the way home. Found this a difficult process. Found the night staff to be much more helpful than the day staff who appeared quite lazy. In saying this, the location was only a 5 minute walk to Boat and Clarke Quays,",3

The girl booking us in was not accommodating at all, must have been too early for her. Where as when we arrived in London at 6:00 am they advised us we can go to our room. About an hour later after just freshening up at the toilet upstairs another receptionist advised to comeback at 12 they might have a room ready. We went for a walk to a very hot humid morning, came back at the hotel at 11:00 to see if they had any rooms available. The girl at reception advised that since it was only 11:00am we couldn't get a room but if we paid an extra $40 for a deluxe room we can have one.

Overall, for a BUDGET HOTEL, the room is clean, everything is clean, the cleaner made our room everyday, toilet is clean, air-cond is working, hot shower is working, Yes, the room is small, but I've stayed in a 4 star hotel at Clarke Quay, it's small as well. The only downside was that the pillow is too soft. Bus stop is just in front of the hotel, taxis are plenty available. If you want the closest MRT, just get a bus in front of the hotel and stop at Lavender Stn. I've stayed at worse budget hotel, this would be the best of all.",5

I went there with my friends in total 6 persons. I face some problems like out of service telephone, no voice from TV. But those things are acceptable except the LOCATION!!. I'm not going to recommend this if you go alone. I know the around the hotel there are many prostitutes before I went but it is more than I though. You can find them even in front of the hotel they work even in daytime and plus many more of them in nighttime. If you come with your friend it will be ok they will only look at you but not approach.

It's a little out of the city centre, but the train station is a 10 minute walk away, so getting around Singapore was no problem at all. There were places to eat at the end of the road and we didn't see any hookers when we were walking around at nighttime (which is apparently what Geylang is known for).",3

The front desk got our hopes up by saying they had upgraded us to a bigger room. He probably shouldn't have raised our expectations like that. We went up two floors to our room. The smell of cigarette smoke hang in the air. Couldn't be sure if that was current or from decades of smoking that had just stuck in to the fabric of the hotel. The room itself was tiny (thanks for that upgrade) and big enough for a double bed and single bed, bathroom and small desk. The furniture was all chipped and stained.

Getting to the hotel from the airport is fairly easy IF google maps works correctly or IF the map used is accurate (ours wasnt). The subway system from airport to hotel was easy to understand & the hotel was on the same line as the airport train (green). Surrounding the hotel are street vendors and the train station is about a 10 min walk. My bf & I initially got lost & couldnt find it.

Geylang comes to life at night as it plays host to street stalls & noodle bars that offer cheap Asian dishes in typical clean Singaporean style. The neon lights& buzz make Geylang a great place to drink & eat cheap food without paying the ridiculous tourist prices. Not only randy old men but locals hang out at here too.

To be honest I've stayed in 3-4 star hotels which were not as nice as 1-2star Ruby. We did not find area as dodgy. Even walking around in the middle of the night did not make us feel unsafe.
