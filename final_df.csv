And there are some rooms with one big bed that has no window. I think the window only available for family room. For moslem will find it hard to do the prayer since the room is so small.

We went down to front desk to get a new towel and they said house keeping is gone for the day and to try again tomorrow. Well. It’s a hot day. I would like to dry myself after showering.

The only reason I am commenting on this hotel is at the time this was not worth typing about and that I don't want anyone to be disheartened after booking and finding out how terrible this hotel is. After having a beautiful room with a balcony on our boat, we checked into the Fragrance Hotel. We arrived at 9.00am and they wouldn't let us into the room until 2.00pm so we had to go back out until that time. They did however store our cases (in the lobby where you can't swing a cat in). When we were shown our rooms at 2.00pm I almost cried. The room was so small you had nowhere to put your case to unpack. Instead you had to open it up in your small lobby in between the shower and your bed! No fridge.

ibis budget Singapore Ruby, November 2015,Perfect for the price,This hotel is conveniently located in the middle of the Geylang area only 600m from the Aljunied MRT (same line with a transfer at Tana Merah) as Changi airport.
